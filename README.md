# Project: Home Credit Default Risk

Predict if an applicant is capable to repay a loan

## Context: 

This project is inspired by a Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data

The principal purpose of this project is to visualize large datasets with different python tools to extract meaningful statistical information from the data. Besides, a variety of preprocessing techniques are also applied to deal with the missing values, outliers, and imbalance of the dataset. Finally, the cleaned data is classified based on the Adaboost method which is one of the most recent algorithms for classifying large datasets.

You can also refer to my notebook https://github.com/KhuyenLE-maths/Project_Income_Classification for further information about some popular machine learning algorithms for classifying data, as well as the comparison between them.
